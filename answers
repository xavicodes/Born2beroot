Purpose of apparmor
    Containment: AppArmor helps contain applications, limiting the damage they can do if compromised.
    Mitigating Risks: It reduces the attack surface by preventing applications from accessing sensitive files or executing unauthorized actions.
    Compliance: Helps in meeting security compliance requirements by enforcing strict access controls.

apt and aptitude are both package management tools for Debian-based systems, but they have some key differences:


 Purpose and Design

    apt:
        A command-line interface for managing packages, designed to be user-friendly and straightforward.
        Combines several functions from older tools like apt-get and apt-cache.

    aptitude:
        A more advanced package management tool that provides a text-based user interface (TUI) as well as command-line functionality.
        Offers a more comprehensive set of features for managing packages and resolving dependencies.

        Summary

    Rocky Linux is best for those looking for a stable, enterprise-grade OS with RHEL compatibility.
    Debian is ideal for users who want a versatile and highly customizable distribution suitable for a variety of applications.


    What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?

A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a physical machine but operates on a host system using hypervisor software.


Great choice! Hereâ€™s a concise overview of virtual machines (VMs):
What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?

A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a physical machine but operates on a host system using hypervisor software.
How Does It Work?

    Hypervisor: This is the software layer that creates and manages VMs. It sits between the hardware and the operating systems, allowing multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine.

    Isolation: Each VM is isolated from others, meaning changes in one VM do not affect others or the host system.

    Resources: VMs share the physical resources of the host (CPU, memory, disk space). The hypervisor allocates these resources as needed.
